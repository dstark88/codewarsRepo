    <h1>Avengers Clerk</h1>
    <p>The new "Avengers" movie has just been released! There are a lot of people at the cinema box office standing in a
        huge line. Each of them has a single 100, 50 or 25 dollar bill. An "Avengers" ticket costs 25 dollars.</p>
    <p>Vasya is currently working as a clerk. He wants to sell a ticket to every single person in this line.</p>
    <p>Can Vasya sell a ticket to every person and give change if he initially has no money and sells the tickets
        strictly in the order people queue?</p>
    <p>Return YES, if Vasya can sell a ticket to every person and give change with the bills he has at hand at that
        moment. Otherwise return NO.</p>

    <ul>Examples:
        <li>
            tickets([25, 25, 50]) // => YES
        </li>
        <li>
            tickets([25, 100]) // => NO. Vasya will not have enough money to give change to 100 dollars
        </li>
        <li>
            tickets([25, 25, 50, 50, 100]) // => NO. Vasya will not have the right bills to give 75 dollars of change
            (you can't make two bills of 25 from one of 50)
        </li>
    </ul>
