    <h3>There was a test in your class and you passed it. Congratulations!
        <br>
        But you're an ambitious person. You want to know if you're better than the average student in your class.
        <br>
        You receive an array with your peers' test scores. Now calculate the average and compare your score!
        <br>
        Return True if you're better, else False!
        <br>
        Note:
        <br>
        Your points are not included in the array of your class's points. For calculating the average point you may add
        your point to the given array!</h3>
